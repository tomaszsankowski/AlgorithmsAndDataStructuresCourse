# AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresCourse
Three projects from my Algorithms and Data Structures course: CSS parser, GIPF game solver and shortest path finder.


Implementation of projects below required me to implement own classes of data structures such as string, double-linked list (also with buckets of given size), hash table, queue and minheap. I also had to use bfs and Dijkstra algorithms in ShortestPathFinder. Here's a short description of each project:

- CSS parser: for given in console CSS expressions program stores its selectors and their attributes; then we can put commands which allows us to for example count attributes and selectors, count how many specified selectors we have or delete selectors with their attributes
- ShortestPathFinder: we are given a board consisting of dots (unused space), letters (name of the cities), hashtags (paths) and stars (points where the city is on the board). Also, we get a list of possible flights between cities. After that, we get questions asking how long would it take to travel from one city to another.
- GIPF: the project was to create a game engine for GIPF, which is a logic game. The engine was able to check if given game state or move is legal and to generate all possible moves for given game state.
